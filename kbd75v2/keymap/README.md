This is a 83-key layout.
The goal is to make everyday coding and debugging simple and comfortable.

Features:

- Large **[Shift]**, right **[Control]** and **[Alt]** keys.
- Almost all TKL keys are on the base layer. In particular all keys from
  the navigation cluster.
- **[Delete]** is in the top right corner, easy to find.
- **[Fn]** is a second function of **[Caps Lock]** key. Doesn't have a dedicated **[Fn]** key.
- Keyboard settings moved to a special layer that is not so easy to access
  (**[Caps Lock + Escape]**). This was done on purpose to prevent accidental key
  presses. **[Caps Lock + Escape + Backspace]** switches the keyboard into
  bootloader mode.
- Bootmagic is configured in "lite" mode. Press **[Backspace]** while connecting
  the keyboard to USB to reset EEPROM and jump into bootloader.
  Note that **[Caps Lock + Escape + Backspace]** does not reset EEPROM.
